The condition variable API is vastly simplified compared
to the pthread version. We assume that each mutex can have a single condition
associated with it. This works well if we just want the CM waiting on the condition that a
client sends a request, and that clients will block waiting on the condition that the CM
replies to them. Because of this, we need only specify the mutex id that the condition
variable is associated with, and not which condition variable to use.

it wakes all threads, or just one.
